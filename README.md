# The Fairytale School of MFL

## Concept

The Fairytale School of MFL is monitoring its students' achievements in language-learning closely and want to target areas for development as their Year 10 pupils move into their final GCSE year of examinations. 

They need a programme that can track student data based on their achievement in each module taught throughout the GCSE programme, combined with data from the mock GCSE examination results, and inform them of the modules of study that need to be revisited for further consolidation as well as specific examination skills where pupils need most practice. 

This programme is designed for the user (teachers at the school) to input student data, calculate a median percentage of achievement per module and exam skill, and identify the primary module and skill to target for intervention sessions. 

## Logic Path Flow Chart

The programme needs to follow a specific path of logic in order to accurately read and calculate the data required by the user. For this, I have created the flow chart as seen below:
